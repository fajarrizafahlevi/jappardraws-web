      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        It was started almost six years ago, in mid-2017. My internship was delayed to October.
        Since there were not many things to do, I thought of spending my holiday learning more about
        drawing.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started my art journey by drawing every day and watching some youtube videos to learn the
        fundamentals. Apparently, someone I knew from the singing community had a little problem.
        Her group had a stickers project that had been abandoned for a few months. I asked her if I
        could help them in any way since I also have to practice my drawing skill. Fortunately, they
        let me help to line art their stickers. Since I do not have a pen tablet yet, I did the line
        art using a mouse. It was kinda difficult, but I was glad the drawing software feature
        allowed me to finish the job. A friend there started to commission me and even helped me to
        buy my first pen tablet, which I still use today.
        <br />
        <br />I keep doing commissions, but only for people I knew there. I prepared a few things
        and finally opened the commission to the public on various platforms such as Facebook,
        Artist&Clients, Sketchmob, and Fiverr. Until today, I have finished almost 100 orders.
