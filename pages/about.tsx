      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        It started in mid-2017, and my internship was delayed to October. Since there weren't many
        things to do, I thought of spending my holiday learning more about drawing. I came across a
        YouTuber called Ross Draws, which inspired me to start my art journey.

        <br />
        I learned some fundamentals from various videos on youtube and practiced them in my
        sketchbook. I also tried digital art using a mouse since I cannot afford a drawing tablet.
        Later, I got a project in the singing community to help a group with their LINE stickers,
        specifically the line art part. At that time, I was using a free drawing software called
        Medibang. It has a good stabilizer, which allows me to draw and finish the job even only
        using a mouse. After that, I focused on digital art and started to open commissions to
        people I know from the community. I finally bought my first drawing tablet: Wacom Intuos
        Draw CTL-490, which I still use today.

        In early 2020, I prepared a few things to open my art commissions to the public on various
        platforms such as Facebook, Artist&Clients, Sketchmob, and Fiverr. Until today, I have
        finished almost 100 orders.
